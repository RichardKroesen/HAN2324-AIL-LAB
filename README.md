# EMBEDDED MACHINE LEARNING LAB
This repository, created by Victor Hogeweij and Richard Kroesen is a collection of our work during the Embedded Machine Learning workshop course in semester 6 of Embedded Systems Engineering at HAN University of Applied Sciences (#madebyese).

# 1 Introduction
Here is a comprehensive description for project's context.  

## 1.1 Project's Purpose
- Gets acquainted with simple supervised machine learning models for embedded systems, such as decision tree and
random forest.
- Gathers data from sensors and/or other sources and extracts relevant characteristics.
- Explores the features and processes them for application in an ML model.
- Designs, optimises and validates an ML model.
- Implements and tests the ML model on an embedded system.

## 1.2 Project's Objective
Our project objective is: "To develop a validation indicator for correct thorax thumbs placement within Johan Korten's HCL-Babypatient simulator project. We aim to adhere strictly to the assignment's approach in a pragmatic manner, avoiding unnecessary complexity or advanced features. While challenging for us the focus remains on practical implementation rather than pursuing fanciful enhancements." 

## 1.2 Assignment 
A hands-on approach is applied, and the learning progress is assessed through a 'mini' project... (not really.)
The only requirements for the project are:
1. There is a continuous DAQ for a sensor or other information input.
2. The system should make an independent classification decision from a couple of choices.
